## 1. Multiple Testing & False Discoveries

### The Problem: Selection Bias

When you test N trading strategies and select the best one, you're not evaluating that strategy in isolation—you're evaluating the **maximum of N random variables**. Even if all strategies have zero expected return, you'll observe a positive Sharpe ratio for the best one simply due to chance.

**Example**: Test 100 random strategies (all with true SR = 0). The expected observed Sharpe for the best one is approximately:

```
E[max{SR}] ≈ √(2 × log(100)) / √T ≈ 3.0 / √T
```

For T = 252 daily observations, this is about **0.19** — a spurious "edge" from pure noise.

This is the **multiple testing problem**, and it's pervasive in quantitative finance where researchers routinely test hundreds or thousands of parameter combinations.

---

### Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR)

**Implementation**: `ml4t.diagnostic.evaluation.stats.deflated_sharpe_ratio()`

**What it does**: Adjusts an observed Sharpe ratio downward to account for the number of strategies tested, providing a probability that the true Sharpe ratio exceeds zero after accounting for selection bias.

**Why it matters**: A strategy with SR = 2.0 sounds impressive, but if you tested 1000 parameter combinations to find it, that SR may be entirely explained by selection bias.

#### Mathematical Foundation

The DSR extends the Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio (PSR) to account for multiple testing. The key insight is that the maximum of K independent Sharpe ratios follows an extreme value distribution.

**Formula** (López de Prado et al., 2025):

```
DSR = Φ((SR̂ - E[max{SR}]) / σ[SR̂])
```

Where:
- `SR̂` = observed (best) Sharpe ratio
- `E[max{SR}] = √Var[{SR_k}] × E[max{Z}]` = expected maximum under null
- `E[max{Z}] ≈ (1-γ)Φ⁻¹(1-1/K) + γΦ⁻¹(1-1/(Ke))` (Euler-Mascheroni approximation)
- `σ[SR̂] = √((1 - γ₃SR₀ + (γ₄-1)/4 × SR₀²) / T)` = standard error accounting for skewness/kurtosis
- `γ ≈ 0.5772` = Euler-Mascheroni constant

#### Usage Example

```python
from ml4t.diagnostic.evaluation.stats import deflated_sharpe_ratio_from_statistics

# You tested 50 strategies, selected the best one, and already computed the cohort statistics
result = deflated_sharpe_ratio_from_statistics(
    observed_sharpe=1.5,      # Best strategy's SR
    n_trials=50,              # Number tested
    variance_trials=1.0,      # Var[{SR_1, ..., SR_50}]
    n_samples=252,            # Days of data
    skewness=0.0,             # Return skewness
    excess_kurtosis=0.0,      # Fisher convention (normal=0)
)

print(f"DSR probability: {result.probability:.3f}")
print(f"Expected max under null: {result.expected_max_sharpe:.3f}")
print(f"p-value: {result.p_value:.3f}")
```

**Critical Requirement**: You must provide the **actual variance** of Sharpe ratios across all K strategies tested. DSR cannot be meaningfully calculated without access to all strategies.

**Interpretation**:
- DSR = 0.95: 95% confidence that true SR > 0 after multiple testing correction
- DSR = 0.50: Coin flip—strategy is likely explained by selection bias
- DSR < 0.05: Strategy almost certainly overfit

### Rademacher Anti-Serum (RAS)

**Implementation**: `ml4t.diagnostic.evaluation.stats.rademacher_complexity()`, `ras_ic_adjustment()`, `ras_sharpe_adjustment()`

**What it does**: Provides probabilistic lower bounds on true performance metrics (Sharpe ratios or ICs) that account for both data snooping AND strategy correlation.

**Why it matters**: DSR assumes strategies are independent. In practice, strategies are often correlated (e.g., variants of the same signal). RAS correctly handles this through the **Rademacher complexity**, which measures how well strategies can fit random noise *given their correlation structure*.

#### Mathematical Foundation

The Rademacher complexity measures the expected correlation between a strategy's predictions and random noise:

```
R̂ = E_ε[max_n (ε^T x^n / T)]
```

Where ε is a **Rademacher vector** (random ±1 with probability 0.5).

**Key Insight**: If strategies are highly correlated, they all move together and can't independently fit different noise patterns. This means R̂ is lower, and less adjustment is needed. If strategies are independent, R̂ approaches the **Massart bound** √(2logN/T), requiring maximum adjustment.

#### Two Procedures (Paleologo, 2024)

**Procedure 8.1 - For Information Coefficients** (bounded |IC| ≤ κ):
```
θ_n ≥ θ̂_n - 2R̂ - 2κ√(log(2/δ)/T)
         ────    ─────────────────
      data snooping  estimation error
```

**Procedure 8.2 - For Sharpe Ratios** (sub-Gaussian):
```
θ_n ≥ θ̂_n - 2R̂ - 3√(2log(2/δ)/T) - √(2log(2N/δ)/T)
         ────   ────────────────────────────────────
      data snooping      estimation error
```

With probability ≥ (1-δ), these bounds hold **simultaneously for ALL N strategies** (not just the selected one).

#### Usage Example

```python
from ml4t.diagnostic.evaluation.stats import (
    rademacher_complexity,
    ras_ic_adjustment,
    ras_sharpe_adjustment
)
import numpy as np

# Strategy performance matrix: T periods × N strategies
X = np.random.randn(2500, 500)  # 2500 days, 500 strategies
observed_sharpe = X.mean(axis=0)

# Step 1: Compute Rademacher complexity
R_hat = rademacher_complexity(X, n_simulations=1000, random_state=42)
print(f"Rademacher complexity: {R_hat:.4f}")
print(f"Massart bound: {np.sqrt(2 * np.log(500) / 2500):.4f}")

# Step 2: Apply RAS adjustment
adjusted_sharpe = ras_sharpe_adjustment(
    observed_sharpe=observed_sharpe,
    complexity=R_hat,
    n_samples=2500,
    n_strategies=500,
    delta=0.05  # 95% confidence
)

# Count significant strategies
n_significant = np.sum(adjusted_sharpe > 0)
print(f"Significant strategies: {n_significant}/500")
```

#### Advantages over DSR

| Property | DSR | RAS |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Accounts for correlation | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (via R̂) |
| Bound type | Asymptotic | Non-asymptotic |
| Scale | ~1000 strategies | Millions |
| False discovery rate | ~0.5% | ~0% |
| Computational cost | O(1) | O(n_sim × T × N) |

---

### False Discovery Rate (FDR)

**Implementation**: `ml4t.diagnostic.evaluation.stats.benjamini_hochberg_fdr()`, `holm_bonferroni()`

**What it does**: Controls the expected proportion of false discoveries among rejected hypotheses.

**Why it matters**: FWER methods (Bonferroni, Holm) control the probability of *any* false positive, which becomes extremely conservative when testing hundreds of hypotheses. FDR instead controls the *proportion* of false positives, allowing more discoveries.

#### Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure (1995)

1. Sort p-values ascending: p_(1) ≤ p_(2) ≤ ... ≤ p_(m)
2. Find largest k such that p_(k) ≤ k × q / m
3. Reject hypotheses 1, 2, ..., k

This controls FDR at level q:
```
E[V/R] ≤ q
```
where V = false discoveries, R = total rejections.

#### Local FDR vs Tail-Area FDR (Efron & Hastie, 2016)

The **local** false discovery rate at z:
```
fdr(z) = π₀f₀(z) / f(z)
```

The **tail-area** FDR:
```
Fdr(z) = π₀F₀(z) / F(z)
```

- **fdr(z)**: "Given this specific z-value, what's the probability it's null?"
- **Fdr(z)**: "Among all z-values at least this extreme, what proportion are null?"

#### Usage Example

```python
from ml4t.diagnostic.evaluation.stats import benjamini_hochberg_fdr, holm_bonferroni

p_values = [0.001, 0.01, 0.03, 0.08, 0.12, 0.25, 0.45]

# FDR control (less conservative, more discoveries)
fdr_result = benjamini_hochberg_fdr(p_values, alpha=0.05, return_details=True)
print(f"BH rejections: {fdr_result['n_rejected']}")

# FWER control (more conservative, fewer false positives)
fwer_result = holm_bonferroni(p_values, alpha=0.05)
print(f"Holm rejections: {fwer_result['n_rejected']}")
```

**When to use FDR vs FWER**:
- **FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg)**: Exploratory analysis, acceptable to have some false discoveries
- **FWER (Holm-Bonferroni)**: Confirmatory analysis, must avoid any false positive

### Choosing Between DSR, RAS, and FDR

| Method | Best For | Accounts for Correlation? | Computational Cost |
|--------|----------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **DSR** | Quick assessment of single best strategy | No | O(1) |
| **RAS** | Rigorous bounds on all strategies simultaneously | Yes | O(n_sim × T × N) |
| **FDR** | Screening many p-values, exploratory | No | O(N log N) |

**Decision Guide**:

1. **I tested many parameter combinations and selected the best one**:
   - Use **DSR** for quick assessment
   - Use **RAS** if strategies are correlated (parameter variations usually are)

2. **I have p-values from multiple independent tests**:
   - Use **FDR (BH)** for exploratory analysis
   - Use **FWER (Holm)** for confirmatory analysis

3. **I need simultaneous bounds on all strategies**:
   - Use **RAS** — bounds hold for all N strategies at once

## 2. Cross-Validation for Financial Data

### Why Standard K-Fold Fails

Standard K-fold cross-validation assumes observations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Financial time series violate this:

1. **Serial Correlation**: Adjacent returns are not independent
2. **Overlapping Labels**: Forward-looking labels create information leakage

**Example of Label Leakage**:
```
Sample 95's label = returns from days 95-100
Sample 100 is in test set
→ Training on sample 95 reveals information about test sample 100
```

**Consequence**: Inflated performance estimates, models that don't generalize.

---

### Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (CPCV)

**Implementation**: `ml4t.diagnostic.splitters.CombinatorialCV`

**What it does**: Generates multiple train/test splits by combining groups, with proper purging and embargo to prevent information leakage.

**Why it matters**: Instead of a single backtest path, CPCV provides a *distribution* of performance metrics, enabling detection of backtest overfitting.

#### How It Works

1. **Partitioning**: Divide time-series into N contiguous groups
2. **Combination Generation**: Generate all C(N,k) combinations of k test groups
3. **Purging**: Remove training samples that overlap with test labels
4. **Embargo**: Add buffer periods after test groups

Number of backtest paths = C(N,k):
- C(8,2) = 28 paths
- C(10,3) = 120 paths
- C(12,4) = 495 paths

#### Usage Example

```python
from ml4t.diagnostic.splitters import CombinatorialCV
import numpy as np

X = np.random.randn(1000, 10)
y = np.random.randn(1000)

cv = CombinatorialCV(
    n_groups=8,           # Split into 8 time groups
    n_test_groups=2,      # 2 groups for testing → C(8,2)=28 combinations
    label_horizon=5,      # Labels look forward 5 samples
    embargo_size=2,       # 2-sample buffer after test
    max_combinations=20   # Limit for efficiency
)

scores = []
for train_idx, test_idx in cv.split(X):
    # Train and evaluate your model
    pass
```

### Purging & Embargo

**Implementation**: `ml4t.diagnostic.core.purging.apply_purging_and_embargo()`

**Purging** removes training samples whose labels temporally overlap with test samples.

**Formula**: For test range [t_start, t_end] and label_horizon h:
```
Remove training samples where: t_train > t_start - h
```

**Embargo** adds a buffer after test groups to account for serial correlation.

**Formula**: After test range with embargo e:
```
Additionally remove: samples t_end+1 to t_end+e
```

**Reference**: López de Prado (2018), Chapter 7, Section 7.4.

## 3. Information Coefficient Analysis

### HAC-Adjusted Standard Errors

**Implementation**: `ml4t.diagnostic.evaluation.stats.hac_adjusted_ic()`

Computes standard errors for the Information Coefficient that account for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation.

**The Newey-West estimator** (1987):

```
V̂[β] = (X'X)⁻¹ (Σ_j=-L^L w_j Γ̂_j) (X'X)⁻¹
```

Where w_j = 1 - |j|/(L+1) (Bartlett kernel).

### Stationary Bootstrap

**Implementation**: `ml4t.diagnostic.evaluation.stats.stationary_bootstrap_ic()`

The **stationary bootstrap** (Politis & Romano, 1994) preserves temporal
dependence through random block lengths and provides a resampling alternative
to HAC inference.

## 4. Statistical Tests

### Stationarity Tests

| Test | Null Hypothesis | Implementation |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **ADF** | Unit root (non-stationary) | `adf_test()` |
| **KPSS** | Stationary | `kpss_test()` |
| **Phillips-Perron** | Unit root | `pp_test()` |

**Best Practice**: Use ADF and KPSS together. If ADF rejects and KPSS doesn't reject, series is stationary.

### Distribution Tests

| Test | Best For | Implementation |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Jarque-Bera** | Large samples (n > 2000) | `jarque_bera_test()` |
| **Shapiro-Wilk** | Small samples (n < 2000) | `shapiro_wilk_test()` |

### Volatility Tests

| Test | Purpose | Implementation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **ARCH-LM** | Test for volatility clustering | `arch_lm_test()` |
| **GARCH** | Model conditional volatility | `fit_garch()` |

---

## 5. Feature Importance

**Implementation**: `ml4t.diagnostic.metrics`

| Method | Type | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|------|-----------|------------|
| **MDI** | In-sample, tree-based | Fast | Biased toward high-cardinality |
| **MDA/PFI** | Out-of-sample, permutation | Unbiased | Computationally expensive |
| **SHAP** | Model-agnostic | Theoretically grounded | Most expensive |

**Best Practice** (López de Prado, 2018):
1. Use **clustered MDI** to group correlated features
2. Validate with **MDA** on out-of-sample data
3. Never trust a single method — use consensus

**Key Insight**: "Backtesting is not a research tool. Feature importance is."

## 6. Risk Model Evaluation

### Why This Matters

Risk models (covariance matrices) are fundamental to portfolio construction. A flawed risk model leads to suboptimal portfolios, excessive concentration, and unexpected drawdowns. Yet validation is often neglected because "testing is hard, mundane, and humbling."

> "Everybody wants to save the Earth; nobody wants to help Mom do the dishes. This is a chapter about doing dishes."
>
> — Paleologo (2024), Chapter 5

### The R-Squared Trap

**Do NOT use R-squared to evaluate factor risk models.** R-squared is **rotationally invariant**: applying random rotation matrices to factors changes the covariance structure but leaves R-squared identical.

**Mathematical Proof** (Paleologo, 2024): Let B be factor loadings. Applying random rotation R:
- New covariance: (BR)(BR)ᵀ = BRRᵀBᵀ ≠ BBᵀ (structure changed)
- R-squared: identical (depends only on explained variance ratio)

### Robust Volatility Loss Functions

**QLIKE Loss** (Patton, 2009):
```
QLIKE(σ̂, r) := (1/T) Σ [r²/σ̂² - log(r²/σ̂²) - 1]
```

**Why QLIKE > MSE**: QLIKE is proportional to negative log-likelihood of normal distribution. It penalizes underestimation of risk more appropriately in certain regimes.

**Implementation**: `ml4t.diagnostic.evaluation.risk.qlike_loss()`

### Precision Matrix Testing

Portfolio weights in mean-variance optimization depend on Σ⁻¹ (precision matrix). Errors in Σ⁻¹ amplify realized risk.

**Mahalanobis Variance Test (MALV)**:
```
νₜ := (1/n) rₜᵀ Σ̂⁻¹ rₜ
MALV := var(ν₁, ..., νT)
```

If the risk model is perfect and returns are Gaussian, νₜ follows χ²(n)/n distribution with low variance. High MALV indicates the precision matrix fails to properly whiten residuals.

**Reference**: Paleologo (2024), Chapter 5, Section 5.2.2.

### Minimum Variance Portfolio Test

**Theorem** (Engle & Colacito, 2006; Paleologo, 2024):
> The realized volatility of portfolio w(Σ̂) is greater than w(Σ), and equal if and only if Σ̂ ∝ Σ.

**Implication**: Build MVP using your predicted Σ̂, measure realized variance. Lower is better.

### Factor Model Turnover

```
turnover_F := (1/T) Σ ||Pₜ - Pₜ₋₁||_F
```

Where Pₜ = factor mimicking portfolio weights.

High turnover means factor definitions change frequently, inducing trading costs *independent of alpha*. This is often overlooked.
