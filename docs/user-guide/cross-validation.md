# Cross-Validation

Use `WalkForwardCV` for chronological model evaluation. Use `CombinatorialCV`
when you need multiple backtest paths and a distribution of out-of-sample
results.
Supply observations in time order, with each feature row aligned to its label.
Set `label_horizon` to the number of observations used by each forward label;
purging by less than the actual label window can leak outcomes into training.
Do not shuffle rows before splitting.

## Run purged walk-forward validation

```python
import numpy as np

from ml4t.diagnostic.splitters import WalkForwardCV

features = np.arange(600, dtype=float).reshape(300, 2)
cv = WalkForwardCV(
    n_splits=4,
    train_size=120,
    test_size=40,
    label_horizon=5,
    expanding=False,
)

walk_forward_splits = list(cv.split(features))
assert len(walk_forward_splits) == 4
assert all(train.max() < test.min() for train, test in walk_forward_splits)
assert all(test.min() - train.max() > cv.label_horizon for train, test in walk_forward_splits)

for fold, (train, test) in enumerate(walk_forward_splits, start=1):
    print(f"Fold {fold}: {len(train)} train, {len(test)} test")
```

`label_horizon=5` removes training observations whose five-period forward
labels would overlap the test set. The assertions check fold count,
chronological order, and the label gap. Index separation does not prove that
feature construction itself avoided future data.

## Run combinatorial purged validation

```python
import math

import numpy as np

from ml4t.diagnostic.splitters import CombinatorialCV

features = np.arange(600, dtype=float).reshape(300, 2)
cpcv = CombinatorialCV(
    n_groups=6,
    n_test_groups=2,
    label_horizon=5,
    embargo_size=2,
    isolate_groups=False,
)

combinatorial_splits = list(cpcv.split(features))
assert len(combinatorial_splits) == math.comb(6, 2)
assert all(
    len(np.intersect1d(train, test)) == 0
    for train, test in combinatorial_splits
)
assert all(
    not any(
        np.intersect1d(np.arange(index + 1, index + cpcv.label_horizon + 1), test).size
        for index in train
    )
    for train, test in combinatorial_splits
)
print(f"CPCV combinations: {len(combinatorial_splits)}")
```

CPCV test groups can occur on either side of a training group. Verify
purging around every test group and account for the chosen embargo.

## Combine CPCV results with DSR

`ValidatedCrossValidation` summarizes fold Sharpe ratios and corrects the best
observed result for the number of trials.

```python
from ml4t.diagnostic import ValidatedCrossValidation

validation = ValidatedCrossValidation()
validation_result = validation.evaluate_sharpes([0.42, 0.51, 0.37, 0.48, 0.45])

assert validation_result.n_folds == 5
print(validation_result.summary())
```

## Select a splitter

| Requirement | Splitter |
|-------------|----------|
| Train only on observations before each test fold | `WalkForwardCV` |
| Measure performance across many test-group combinations | `CombinatorialCV` |
| Preserve a final untouched period | `WalkForwardCV` with `test_period` or `test_start` |
| Bound CPCV computation | `CombinatorialCV` with `max_combinations` |

Serialize splitter settings with the [CV configuration guide](cv-configuration.md).
The [CPCV method page](../methods/cpcv.md) explains the group and combination
parameters.
The [cross-validation API reference](../api/index.md#cross-validation)
documents both splitters. The book's
[CV foundations notebook](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/machine-learning-for-trading/blob/2d6e8f95eeccaee66906245606471f570b5807e5/06_strategy_definition/02_cv_foundations.ipynb)
calls Diagnostic splitters and also constructs folds manually.
