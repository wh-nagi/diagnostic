"""Complete End-to-End Example: From Model Training to PDF Reports.

ML4T Diagnostic provides rigorous statistical evaluation and visualization for ML models,
with a focus on feature analysis and preventing overfitting through proper
statistical testing.

This example demonstrates the complete workflow:
1. Train a model (using sklearn as an example)
2. Analyze feature importance using multiple methods (MDI, PFI, SHAP)
3. Compute feature interactions (SHAP-based)
4. Generate interactive HTML visualizations
5. Export high-quality PDF reports for stakeholders

Why use ML4T Diagnostic?
--------------
- Multi-method importance analysis catches method-specific biases
- SHAP interactions reveal feature synergies often missed by univariate importance
- Interactive HTML reports for exploration, PDFs for presentations
- Designed for financial ML but applicable to any domain

What you'll learn:
-----------------
- How to run importance analysis with consensus ranking
- How to compute and interpret feature interactions
- How to generate publication-quality visualizations
- How to export to PDF for sharing with non-technical stakeholders

Expected runtime: ~10-20 seconds (depending on your machine)

# Create synthetic dataset with known structure:
# - 8 informative features (truly predictive)
# - 3 redundant features (linear combinations of informative features)
# - 4 noise features (random, no predictive power)
# This structure lets us validate that importance methods correctly identify
# the informative features and downweight noise.

    for i in range(15)
]

# Split data - use test set for feature importance to avoid overfitting
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest
# ML4T Diagnostic works with any sklearn-compatible model (RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)

# ============================================================================
# Step 2: Analyze Feature Importance
# ============================================================================
# ML4T Diagnostic supports three importance methods:
#
# - MDI (Mean Decrease Impurity): Fast, built into tree models, but biased
#   toward high-cardinality features. Good for quick exploration.
#
# - PFI (Permutation Feature Importance): Unbiased, model-agnostic, but slower.
#   Measures impact on model performance when feature is shuffled.
#
# - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): Theoretically sound (game theory),
#   provides local + global importance. Slowest but most rigorous.
#
# Using multiple methods provides consensus and catches method-specific biases.

# - Individual method results (importances, rankings)

# ============================================================================
# Step 3: Analyze Feature Interactions (Optional but Powerful!)
# ============================================================================
# Feature importance tells you which features matter in isolation, but
# interactions reveal synergies: features that work together to produce
# stronger effects than either feature alone.
#
# Example: In trading, "momentum" and "volatility" might interact:
# - High momentum + low volatility = strong signal
# - High momentum + high volatility = noise
#
# SHAP interactions decompose predictions into pairwise feature effects.
# Computation is O(n_features²), so we use a subsample for large datasets.

# Interaction strength interpretation:
# - > 0.1: Strong interaction (investigate further)
# - 0.05-0.1: Moderate interaction
# - < 0.05: Weak interaction (may be noise)

# ============================================================================
# Step 4: Generate Interactive HTML Reports
# ============================================================================
# ML4T Diagnostic can generate three types of reports:
#
# 1. Importance Report: Feature rankings, method comparison, consensus
# 2. Interaction Report: Heatmap, network graph, top interactions
# 3. Combined Report: Both importance and interactions in one document

# Available themes: "default", "dark", "presentation" (large fonts)
